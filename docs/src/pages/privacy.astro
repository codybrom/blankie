          <b>Note:</b> We maintain this privacy policy because we believe in transparency
          and because it's required to be part of Apple's ecosystem. To put it plainly,
          your information never leaves your computer. The Blankie app doesn't connect
          to the internet, collect analytics, or track you in any way. When distributed
          through Apple's platforms, Apple provides us with basic anonymous statistics
          about downloads and crashes, but the app binary itself (whether from GitHub
          or the App Store) never collects or transmits any data directly back to
          the developers. The formal policy below explains this in more detail, but
          that's really all there is to it. Your Blankie belongs to you.

        <strong>Effective Date</strong>: January 7, 2025
      </p>

      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        Your privacy is important to us. Blankie itself does not collect, store,
        or share any personal information and there are no tracking or analytics
        frameworks implemented in the app as part of the source code.
      </p>

      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        When you get Blankie through the Mac App Store or join our public
        TestFlight beta, Apple may collect some usage data (as explained in
        their privacy policy). Apple never shares your personal information with
        us unless you explicitly give it to us.
      </p>

      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        From time to time, some contributors may be granted access to private
        internal TestFlight betas. For these private betas, we need to share
        your email address with Apple so they can send you an invitation. This
        email address is only used for the TestFlight invitation process and is
        not shared with anyone else.
      </p>

      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        Apple also shares with us basic anonymous statistics about how many
        people downloaded the app and if it crashes. We use this information to
        make Blankie more stable and reliable. You can learn more about Apple's
        data collection in their

        Data Sharing and Disclosure
      </h2>
      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        Since we do not collect any data, we cannot share anything with any
        third party. However, if you download through Apple's platforms, please
        refer to Apple's privacy policy regarding their data collection
        practices.

      <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
        While Blankie will always remain privacy-focused, Apple's requirements
        and other legal standards may evolve. If we need to update this policy
        to reflect such changes, you'll find the latest version here. Our
        commitment to privacy won't change.
