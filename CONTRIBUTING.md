# Contributing to Blankie

> Hi, @codybrom here, and I'm thrilled you're interested in contributing to Blankie! I was inspired to create Blankie because an incredible community of people came together to support it's inspiration, [Blanket](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/blanket). My hope for Blankie is that a similar community will come together to support its development and growth. I'm excited to see what we can build together!

This document outlines the guidelines, expectations, and processes for contributing to this project. Following these will ensure a smooth and efficient contribution experience for everyone.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute, including:

* **Testing & Bug Reports:** Help test features and identify issues. Find a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=BUG%3A+) using our bug report template.
* **Feature Suggestions:** Have an idea for Blankie? [Submit a feature request](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=IDEA%3A+). Design mockups, UI/UX flows, and even rough sketches are welcome! Be sure to explain your use case and be open to discussion.
* **[Code Contributions](#code-contributions):** Dive right in and help us fix bugs, add new features, improve performance, and enhance Blankie's architecture.
* **[Documentation and Website Contributions](#documentation-and-website-contributions):** Help improve core documentation (like this page), write user guides and make changes or additions to the Blankie website.
* **[Other Ways](#other-contributions):** Interested in contributing in other ways? We're open to new ideas and suggestions, but please check the guidelines below.

### Before You Start

* **Code of Conduct:** Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It ensures a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
* **Check Open / Existing Issues:** Before starting on a new feature or bug fix, check other [issues](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues) to make sure it hasn't already been addressed or reported. You may find a related issue with helpful discussion.
* **Start with Small Steps**: If you’re new to the project, it’s a good idea to begin with smaller tasks to get familiar with the code, contributing, and development processes.

## Code Contributions

If you'd like to help out with the source code, follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the [Blankie repository](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie) to your GitHub account. You can then clone the forked repository to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Your Development Configuration:** Follow the [development setup instructions](README.md#development-setup) to create a `Configuration.xcconfig` file with your own development team and bundle identifier (this file is ignored by git to keep your personal settings private). You may not use the same bundle identifier as the main Blankie app and you should not update these fields in configation of the project itself. Please keep your personal settings private.
3. **Make the Changes:** Write clean and clear code following [Swift.org's guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Use appropriate comments and match the existing code style and conventions in the project. Blankie uses `swift-format` with default settings to keep code clean and consistent. You can run it via XCode (Editor > Structure > Format File with ‘swift-format’) or command line to ensure consistent formatting. If you're unsure about style, feel free to ask in an issue or pull request.
    * Keep your changes focused and avoid unrelated changes in the same pull request. PRs that make unnecessary changes or are too large may be rejected or asked to be split into smaller PRs.
    * If you're adding new features, consider opening an issue first to discuss the feature and gather feedback before starting development.
4. **Test:** Ensure that your changes work correctly without causing issues in other areas. Blankie currently has a few basic unit tests that can be run in XCode to ensure core functions (initial state, sound playback, volume, reset) are performing as expected. You can write additional unit or even UI tests to make sure everything is working before checking in code.
5. **Commit Your Changes:** With each commit, write clear commit messages explaining the reason and context for your changes. This will help other collaborators understand the scope of your contributions.
6. **Create a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request from your branch with a clear explanation of the changes that you've made to the original project repository, along with the links to issues referenced (`Closes #123`, `Fixes #345`) .

### Code Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please exercise extreme caution when modifying **sound configurations**, **naming conventions** or **preset functionality**.
>
>These components directly affect user settings and preferences and even small changes in these areas can significantly impact user experience and existing configurations.

Before implementing changes that might alter core functionality in serious ways:

1. **Discuss First**
   * Open an issue to propose and discuss changes and gather feedback from maintainers and the community

2. **Maintain Core Requirements**
   * Maintain consistent volume normalization across all sounds
   * Ensure smooth transitions between sound states (play/pause/volume)
   * Preserve compatibility with macOS media controls
   * Protect functionality of existing user-saved presets

3. **Implement Carefully**
   * Prioritize backwards-compatible solutions
   * Develop migration paths for existing user settings
   * Document any breaking changes thoroughly in pull requests
   * Consider phased rollouts for major changes

## Translation Contributions

Blankie aims to be accessible to users around the world, which means we need help translating the app into different languages. You don't need to be a programmer to contribute translations!

### Getting Started with Translations

1. **Check Current Status**: Visit our [translations page](https://blankie.rest/i18n) to see which languages already have translations and their status.

2. **Get the Template**: Download a English template or current translation in JSON or CSV format from the [translations page](https://blankie.rest/i18n) with all the strings that need translation.

3. **Edit the Template**: Using any text editor, translate the English strings to your target language. Keep the  structure intact - only modify the "target" content within the strings.

4. **Submit Your Translation**: There are two ways to submit translations:
   * **GitHub Issue**: Create a [translation contribution issue](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues/new?assignees=&labels=translation-contribution&projects=&template=translation_contribution.yml&title=%5BTranslation%5D%3A+) and attach your JSON file
   * **Pull Request**: If you're familiar with Git, you can fork the repository, add your translation file to the `/docs/public/i18n/` directory, and submit a pull request

### Translation Guidelines

* **Respect Context**: The `comment` field provides context about where each string appears in the app. Use this to guide your translation choices.
* **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout the translation.
* **Special Characters**: Pay attention to formatting placeholders like `%@` (which represent variable content) and preserve them in your translation.
* **Testing**: If you have the ability to, you might also test your translations by building the app locally to see how they appear in context.

### Translation Review Process

Once submitted, your translations will go through this process:

1. Initial review by the maintainers
2. For languages we can't verify internally, we may reach out to other community members who speak that language
3. After review, translations will be marked as either "translated" or "needs review"
4. Approved translations will be included in a future Blankie release

### How to Submit Translations

You can submit translations in two ways:

1. **GitHub Issue**: Create a [translation contribution issue](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues/new?assignees=&labels=translation-contribution&projects=&template=translation_contribution.yml&title=%5BTranslation%5D%3A+) and attach your updated JSON or CSV file
2. **Email**: Send your translation files to i18n@blankie.rest

For general translation feedback or to report issues with existing translations, also use the above methods.

If you have any questions at all about translations or need clarification on specific strings, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help!
